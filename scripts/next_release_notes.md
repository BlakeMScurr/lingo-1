This release changes the path of $HOME/.lingo_home to ~/.codelingo. It also introduces a new config format, which is written to $HOME/.codelingo/config/platform.yaml

$HOME/.lingo_home will need to be manually removed after this update.

The tool can now be built from tip with `make install`.

The CodeLingo platform has been updated to provide complete support for PHP semantics. Documentation on how to take advantage of this with CLQL is coming soon.

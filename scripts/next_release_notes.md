This release introduces the capability of ingesting and reviewing large
repositories; new commands to list lexicon/fact info to support autocompletion
plugins; a simplified setup workflow and notifications if an upgrade is
required (client side only, platform upgrade notifications to come).

A sublime autocomplete plugin for .lingo files is included under
scripts/IDE/sublime.
